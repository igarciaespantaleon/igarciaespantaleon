## Hi there, I'm Irene ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of social sciences and computational methods, using quantitative analysis to explore social questions.
I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Computational Social Sciences, where I worked mostly in R, and Iâ€™m now expanding my skills in Python.
