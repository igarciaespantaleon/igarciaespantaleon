## Hi there, I'm Irene ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in the intersection of social sciences and computational methods, using quantitative analysis to explore social questions.
I recently completed my Masterâ€™s in Computational Social Sciences, where I worked mostly in R, and Iâ€™m now expanding my skills in Python.
Currently, Iâ€™m looking to apply these methods in research, policy evaluation, and other data-driven projects. 
This GitHub hosts my coursework, research code, and experiments in data science.
